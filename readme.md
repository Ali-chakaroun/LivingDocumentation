Living Documentation allows you to analyze your dotnet source code and generate comprehensive documentation for your stakeholders.
It's a powerful tool that bridges the gap between code and documentation, ensuring that your documentation is always up-to-date with your source code.

## Features

* **Analyzer**: A tool to analyze dotnet projects or solutions.
* **Libraries**: Assists in generating applications that can create plain text files such as MarkDown, AsciiDoc, PlantUML, Mermaid, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Dotnet 6.0 SDK or newer.

## Installation

Install the analyzer as a dotnet global tool:

```shell
dotnet tool install --global LivingDocumentation.Analyzer
```

## Generating Documentation

Using LivingDocumentation to generate documentation involves a three-step process:

1. **Analyze Source Code**: Run the LivingDocumentation.Analyzer with your Visual Studio solution file as input.
   This will generate an intermediate JSON file containing detailed information about your source code.
2. **Develop Renderers**: Create a custom "render application" to interpret the JSON file and generate various views on your source code, such as class diagrams or sequence diagrams.
3. **Output Documentation**: Export your findings in text-based formats like Markdown, AsciiDoc, PlantUML, Mermaid, etc.

Both during local development, as during your CI&CD pipeline, can follow the same flow.

### Local Development

The analysis of a solution might take some time.
Therefore, an intermediate JSON file is created to speed up the documentation generation process.
This ensures a fast feedback loop when developing your renderers.

## Develop Your Own Renderers

A renderer application can be as simple as a command line tool that takes in the generated JSON files, makes conclusions based on the type information and writes this to a plain text file format.

To get started quickly, you should make a dependency on 2 NuGet packages in your project:

* **LivingDocumentation.RenderExtensions**: Contains extension methods and dependencies for serialized analysis.
* **LivingDocumentation.Json**: Contains JSON serializers and contract resolvers.
